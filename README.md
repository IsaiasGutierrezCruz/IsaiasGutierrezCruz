### Hi there 👋, my name is Isaias
#### Pharmacist Specialized in Data Science | Back-end developer
Currently working at Odde, my own entrepreneur. My main focus these days is generating solutions and knowledge through data analysis of different topics like finance, my own business, biological and social systems, and others. To this end, I usually apply techniques of supervised and unsupervised learning in R and Python. I also like developing different data pipelines and services using back and front-end technologies. 

Skills: Python / R / dplyr / scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Docker / Flask / PostgreSQL / MySQL / PowerBI
